## Overview

A quick introduction to GA4’s purpose, benefits, and core capabilities.

Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is the latest analytics platform from Google, unifying web and app data under an event-based model. It emphasizes privacy, cross-platform tracking, and deeper integration with Google Ads and BigQuery.

---

## User Journey

An outline of the four key stages in the customer lifecycle that GA4 tracks.

GA4 organizes insights into four lifecycle stages:

* **Acquisition:** How users find your property (e.g., campaigns, referrals)
* **Interaction:** User actions (page views, clicks, video plays)
* **Monetization:** Revenue activities (purchases, subscriptions)
* **Retention:** User re-engagement and loyalty over time

---

## Implementation Steps

High‑level overview of the steps to set up GA4 for accurate data collection.

*Implementation* means setting up GA4 tags or SDKs to start collecting accurate data.

1. **Add Tracking Tag**
   Install `gtag.js` on every page or use Google Tag Manager (GTM).
2. **Collect User Data**
   Track device, location, behaviors; mobile apps require Firebase SDK for iOS/Android.
3. **Record Events**
   GA4 auto-tracks common events; define up to 500 custom events via `logEvent()`.
4. **Process & Report**
   Events are transformed into metrics and dimensions for reporting.

## Account Structure

Description of GA4’s hierarchical model for organizing properties and data streams.

| Level           | Definition                       |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Account**     | Container for properties         |
| **Property**    | Individual site or app           |
| **Data Stream** | Web, iOS, or Android data source |

---

## Business Objectives & Key Reports

Link business goals to the GA4 reports and metrics that support them.

| Objective          | Key Reports / Features                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Generate leads     | User & Traffic Acquisition, Landing Pages |
| Drive online sales | E-commerce Purchases, Purchase Journey    |
| Examine behavior   | Events, Conversions, Pages & Screens      |
| Boost awareness    | Ads Campaigns, Demographics               |

## User Roles & Permissions

Overview of the different GA4 access levels and their capabilities.

* **Admin:** Full control including user management
* **Editor:** Edit settings/data (no user mgmt)
* **Marketer:** Manage audiences, conversions
* **Analyst:** Build dashboards, annotations
* **Viewer:** Read-only access

---

## Real-Time Reporting

How to monitor live user activity and troubleshoot data collection issues.

* Shows activity from the past 30 minutes.
* If data is missing, allow up to 24 hours for processing.

---

## Events, Parameters, Dimensions & Metrics

Definitions of GA4’s core data elements used to structure analytics data.

* **Event:** A user interaction (e.g., `video_play`).
* **Parameters:** Context (e.g., `video_name`, `duration`).
* **Dimension:** Qualitative attribute (text).
* **Metric:** Quantitative measure (number count).

---

## Data Configuration & Filters

Guidance on excluding unwanted data sources to ensure clean analytics.

### Unwanted Referrals

Exclude domains (e.g., payment gateways) to maintain accurate session attribution.
**Example:** Remove a payment processor’s domain to avoid inflated drop-off rates.

### Internal & Developer Traffic

* **Internal:** Company IPs
* **Developer:** Testing/staging environments

Exclude these to prevent skewed analytics.

Steps:

1. **Define Internal Traffic:** Admin > Data Stream > Configure Tag Settings > Define Internal Traffic (add IPs).
2. **Create Filter:** Admin > Data Filters > Developer/Internal Traffic (set Testing or Active).

---

## Conversions

Explanation of what counts as a conversion and how to mark key actions.

A *Conversion* is a key action like a purchase or signup.

* Mark events in Admin > Events or Admin > Conversions.
* Changes appear after \~24 hours.

---
